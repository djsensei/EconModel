'''
Small business lifecycle modeling based on individual consumer needs

Written by Dan Morris. 9/27/14 -

Overview:
  We create a city which contains people and small businesses. People generate
    needs each cycle and go to nearby businesses to fulfill those needs. If a
    person cannot find a business close by to fulfill their needs, those needs
    accumulate and their search radius expands. Businesses spend cash each
    cycle, and must take in enough revenue to stay afloat. If a business's cash
    drops below zero, that business dies and can be replaced by a new startup.

  Each cycle represents approximately one earth-week.

Objects:
  City
  Person
  Business
  BusinessLocation
  BusinessType
  DemandType

Helper Files:
  functions.py - contains non-object functions
  business_types.json - contains reference of business types
  demand_types.json - contains reference of demand types
